Changelog

* ImagePanelBlock rollover style used to not respect parent element height suggestions.
  Changed this to match the other image panel block styles.

* ImagePanelBlock listing style says "When in a layout block with Fixed Dimensions as False,
  the image will be square, with its height and width equal to the suggested height on the
  parent layout block." But the code was actually using the height and width from the fixed
  dimensions field EVEN when 'use fixed dimensions' was not selected.
